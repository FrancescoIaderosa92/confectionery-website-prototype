          <h2>About Coco's Chocolatiers</h2>
          <p>Coco's Chocolatiers has a rich history. The company was started back in 1925 during the time when Capone owned this city. Coco's Chocolatiers sttruggled to stay afloat because Capone demanded his protection money.</p>
          <p>After Coco's Chocolatiers was able to sell enough of its chocolates and save up a good amount of money, Coco's Chocolatiers decided to uproot from Chicago and relocate to Canada in 1953.</p>
          <p>Our company now proudly makes its famous chocolates out of a small shop downtown inside the Byward Market. Coco's Chocolatiers has now proudly stood in this location for the past 65 years.</p>
